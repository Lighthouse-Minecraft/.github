# Lighthouse MC Code of Conduct

We’re a family‑friendly, Christ‑centered Minecraft community. We welcome everyone who respects these values.

## Our values

- Love God and love people
- Kindness, humility, honesty, and self‑control
- Safety and respect for all ages and backgrounds

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and build others up
- Keep language and content clean (no swearing, NSFW, gore, or occult themes)
- Play fair: no cheating, dupes, griefing, or harassment
- Ask before modifying other players’ builds; attribute others’ work
- Protect privacy; don’t share personal info without consent
- Follow moderator guidance; accept corrections graciously

## Unacceptable behavior

- Hate speech, bullying, harassment, discrimination, or slurs
- Lewd, explicit, or excessively violent content
- Targeted insults or threats, doxxing, or brigading
- Repeatedly pushing boundaries after being asked to stop

## Scope

This Code applies across our organization, repositories, servers, and community spaces (including voice/text chats and in‑game activity) and to all participants: maintainers, contributors, and players.

## Reporting and enforcement

- If something concerns you, please open an issue and request a private moderator contact, or reach out to a maintainer as documented in the repository.
- Moderators may remove content, restrict access, or issue time‑outs/bans where necessary to protect the community.
- Appeals can be requested via a respectful message to the maintainers.

We aim for restoration when possible, while prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of the community.

## Attribution

This Code is original to Lighthouse MC and inspired by common community standards such as the Contributor Covenant. We may revise it over time; see repository history for updates.
